## Quick Start

This is still a work in progress (no venv, etc.), however below are the current steps to use the cli.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install .
f5 --help
```

Note: Alternatively install from GitLab - ```pip3 install git+https://***REMOVED***/cloudsolutions/f5-cloud-cli.git@develop```
