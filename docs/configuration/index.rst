Configuring the CLI
===================

Where is stateful configuration stored?
---------------------------------------

The F5 CLI stores configuration settings and credentials in the user's home directory inside a folder called :code:`.f5_cli`.  There are a number of files in this folder, below describes each of these files and provides an example of information typically found in each one.

:code:`auth.yaml` - Authentication information such as credentials used by the CLI

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: "bigip1"
      host: "192.0.2.10"
      authentication-type: "bigip"
      password: mypassword1
      port: 443
      username: myuser1
      default: true
    - name: "bigip2"
      host: "44.226.175.52"
      authentication-type: "bigip"
      password: mypassword2
      port: 443
      username: myuser2
      default: false
    - name: "cs1"
      password: "mypassword3"
      authentication-type: "cloud-services"
      username: "myuser1@f5.com‚Äù
      default: true

:code:`config.yaml` - Configuration settings used by the CLI

.. code-block:: yaml

    output: json

.. NOTE:: Typically changing configuration settings in these files is done using the F5 CLI directly, however for advanced use cases it may be a requirement to change the settings directly in these files.
