Introduction
------------

The F5 Cloud CLI provides a command-line interface (CLI) to various F5 products. Those products include BIG-IP, F5 Automation Toolchain, and F5 Cloud Services. The experience of interacting with the CLI mirrors working with other, established, CLIs, such as the Azure, AWS and Google CLIs.

The CLI extends upon the functionality provided in the Automation Toolchain components (AS3, TS, and DO) as well as functionality within the F5 Cloud SDK (such as provisioning F5 Cloud Services subscriptsions).
